We are students from the Master of Science program in Neuroengineering (MSNE) at the Technical University in Munich and are using this site to share our experiences.

This blog serves two purposes:

- We want to write a diary about the many great things that we are doing and experiencing.
- The blog is also supposed to give information to students interested in joining the program.
