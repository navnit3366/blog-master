Germany’s most awaited football tournament, the
~~Champions’ League~~ Elite Cup, was held on Saturday 22<sup>nd</sup> of
June 2019 in Regensburg. Once again, the MSNE football team, the
*Neuruns*, picked up the call of duty.

Despite terrible weather forecasts, which prognosed
heavy storms throughout the day, the Neuruns decided to go at the last
moment (literally), and so they boarded the train towards glory, with an
inherited objective: <span class="underline">score a goal and
break the curse!

This year the Neuruns were pumped-up with reinforcements
from the third batch: Adrià, Laura, Nick and Nogay, along with veteran
players, Mike, Mohammad and Francisco, and invited players, Chris and
Nikolay. We also counted with the support of our MVP (Most Valuable
Photographer) Kelsey Tacca.

Already at the Sports Center of the University of
Regensburg, the weather displayed both dark clouds and a bright sun. Sun
rays reflected on the silver Elite-Cup, which would witness all the
matches until the rightful winners lifted it. After a short warm-up, the
loudspeakers requested the presence of the MSNE contestants on the
field.

The first match of the Neuruns was fairly even, and we
used it to calibrate our feet. However, the Software Engineers knew how
to break our defense twice before the end, resulting in a 0-2 final
score. Needless to say, this result only further motivated our
spirits.

After a quick lunch provided by the organizers, the
Neuruns were in queue to fight the CDTM, last year champions, who had
just come out victorious 4-0 from their first match. When called, we
stormed the field again to fight these titans. The magic could now be
sensed in the air. Mohammad the “Brainbow” was again a stone wall before
the goal, helped by Nikolay in the defense, while Laura and Nick were
ferocious cannons at the attack, and Adrià and Nogay articulated the
midfield. The clash was fierce and tight, but short before the end, in a
series of unfortunate events, our goal was successfully beaten,
resulting in an unfavorable 0-1. It was all-or-nothing now.

Finally, the Neuruns were announced for the third match
against SynCat Regensburg. The match started even, but shortly after the
tides turned to our favor, as the talent emanated from the Neuruns. Mike
the “Dash” kept the defense secure, luckily for me who was in charge of
the goal, so the game was played on the other side of the field. Not too
soon, the inevitable miracle happened: Nick the “Hero” Tacca found his
space, shot with security and broke the curse, **scoring the first goal
ever for the Neuruns!

Overcome with joy, we kept on rocking-and-rolling. In
fact, talent must flow through the Taccas because shortly before the
end, Chris Tacca beautifully broke the defense with another goal, for a
crushing result of 2-0. “Und die Spiele sind... vorbei!” (“And the
matches are over”) claimed the moderator to seal the Neuruns first
victory on the field!

In the play-offs stage, another astonishing display of
talent was carried out by both teams, but we eventually got bettered 0-1
by the rivals and that was it for the ever-improving performance of the
Neuruns!

The final victory went to "Finance and Information
Management (FIM)”. Accordingly, next year’s tournament will take place
in Augsburg. We had a lot of fun this year and we are very much looking
forward to the fourth batch to outperform us next year!

Finally, we would like to thank the organizers
"Honors-Wirtschaftswissenschaften" for such a wonderful event, and the
TUM for covering the transportation costs for us.
