The [Neuroengineering Matinee](http://www.msne.ei.tum.de/en/news/news-single-view/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39&cHash=d81421619425fad597ffecb86e7a9d20) took place the morning of the 16th of
January at the Vorhoelzer Forum. Led by Professor Jakob Macke, two guest
talks were held:

-   [Patrick van der Smagt](https://www.gsn.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/associate/van_der_smagt/index.html), Volkswagen: Latent Optimal Control
-   [Srinivas Turaga](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/srinivas-c-turaga), HHMI's Janelia Research Campus: Connecting the
    Structure and Function of Neural Circuits

Afterwards, MSNE students held a presentation and poster session,
introducing the audience to the research projects carried out during the
program:


-  Christoph Kocher: Measuring effective connectivity with
    convolutional neural networks
-  Pranshul Saini: The effect of intensive meditation training on
    cognitive functioning during Stroop task
-  Yagmur Yener: Fully Automated Reconstruction of Glia and their
    Relationship with Neurons
-  Elisa Pavarino: Connectome of the newborn nerve
-  Jonas Braun: Uncovering muscle population dynamics of locomotion
    using LFADS

Finally, the members of the neuroengineering community further discussed
the topics of interest while enjoying snacks and drinks.
