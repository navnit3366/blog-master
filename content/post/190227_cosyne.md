This year's [Cosyne (Computational and Systems's neuroscience)](http://cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_19) was in the beautiful city of Lisbon, Portugal. It featured thought-provoking talks by Ken Harris, Eric-Shea-Brown and others. After the introduction of powerful tools based on recurrent neural networks in the last years, a common theme seemed to have been to build interpretable models of neural dynamics to use the powerful tools to ask scientific hypotheses. The workshops were in a way to fancy hotel in the seaside town of Cascais and provided a good ground for more detailed scientific discourse of the whole community.

Visiting Cosyne was a great chance for me to get to know the scientific community and learn about all the exciting research going on. Additionally, it was great to see a little bit of Lisbon and its surroundings.
