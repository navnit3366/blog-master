The MSNE Neuruns teams participated in the [TUM Campus Run 2019](https://www.ja.tum.de/en/tum-campuslauf2019/), in both its 5,5 and 11 km flavors. This time the scorching sun made the running conditions particularly harsh, but nonetheless it was great fun. 

Thanks a lot to the organization team of this event, which gets better every year!
